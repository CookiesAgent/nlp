Fleshes the Northern eagle's beak;

And swept them all off from his face and breast.

And al is lieved that sche seith;

And in Val Tenèbres beside them stood;
Towards Saragossa the rout they drave,

Come to my mountain-solitude,
And learn my frustrate life;

As the bubbles spray
And fall in tinkling tunes away.
And up on the hills against the sky,

To every stranger they are kind
To friendship are sincere.
No party spirit there can dwell,

And in the instant lightning flash I saw,--

Of a certain star

But fresh and full the present spoke
In heartfelt song from all its folk.

While it helps promote digestion,

Well begrudge a good old man,

Seas and cities, near and far,
And the flying fairies' looks,

A whispered rumor crept around,

Or in low murmurs they began,
Rising and rising momently,

A hundred long and twenty wide.

Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom

Padding with pompous phrases worn and old

To sooth each painful Passion's wild extremes.
Here shall no empty, vain Intruder chase,
With idle converse, thy enchantment warm,

But the aged father did not mind,

Oh my beloved, gone to heaven from me!

And made a breach

Beneath our feet: the time permitted now

Or make her garland fade.

Of some writhed oak, the wood's Laocoon,

Yonder a light is gleaming; oh, I know it so well!
The air is scented with clover; the cattle wait by the rail;
Father is through with the milking; there goes the supper-bell.

Round about stood slender columns.
Ever dropping from the ceiling

In the mighty ribs of Nahma,
And from peril and from prison,

And desired to touch her hair,

The test of Scripture Truth by whomsoe'er applied.

Sweet as the wind is he in lilac-trees.

Canto II. Brahmá’s Visit
Canto III. The Argument.
~
Behold her, pranked with spurs for bloody sport,
How she acclaims,
A crapulous chanticleer,
~
You never knew the mother of the mother.
She had great power of life and power of soul,
~
Through all that ghastly night I fled,
And still behind me seemed to hear
~
With a climb the ledging summit
~
But long o' her his veins 'ould run
All crinkly like curled maple,
The side she breshed felt full o' sun
~
Two chiefs that mountain for their bearing show,
Which, hiding him, from dragon-feet to head,
The wicked Typheus seems to keep below.
~
Descend in all his splendor.
From your lips
Such words are full of sweetness.
~
With, 'What is gladness without gratitude,
~
The Tories must still be dependent on Britain--
The worst of dependence that ever was hit on.
Now their work is concluded--that pitiful jobb--
~
How take the exchange without despair,
Without worse folly how refuse?'
But she, who, wise as she was fair,
~
And sche lay stille, and of this thing,
~
The jolly cock crawis;
Now shroudis the shawis
Thro' Nature anon.
~
Returning but to die within the house
~
And all this restless rush, this strain and strife,
This noise and glare is but the fanfarade
That ushers in the more majestic life
~
Its branches lend you their immortal food,
~
Is like the pang that thrills my frame for thee!
Georgie, come home!--To parents, brother, sister
~
Now in her ever holy wave
Thyself, O best of heroes, lave:
So shalt thou, pure from every sin,
~
For my dear self to form a part
Wherein the keen, applauding eye
Might dwell on my deformity,
~
Now a new heaven and new earth appear;
And, coming down from heaven, even as a bride
Adorned to meet her husband, John beheld
~
And they on earth who've wept the most
~
And fill this void with warm, creative ray?
Would I could sleep again till, clear and red,
Morning shall on the mountain-tops be spread!
~
So - faces on two Decks look back -
~
Whose light thro' the wave was seen.
"'Tis Innisfail--'tis Innisfail!"

Its sweep, till, more abrupt, a wooded knoll,
Where once a castle frowned, closes the scene.
And see! an infant troop, with flags and drum,
~
Begotten, deem that none are left me now.
Fifty there were, when came the sons of Greece;
Nineteen the offspring of a single womb;

And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove.

Dropped leaf for aught that age or storms might wreak.

And near and far, hammers, and clanking steel,
Neighs from impatient barbs, and runic song

Ha! ha! that story is very clever,
But has no foundation whatsoever.
~
Of that noble deed which was done by the maiden I spoke of,
Of her betroth'd's sad death, a noble young man who, incited
~
Thus on Life's lonely sea,
Heareth the marinere
Voices sad, from far and near,
~
Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:
Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,
Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.
~
Do sing a sadder verse.
~
Exhausted; lavished in a god's control.
~
She bade me tell her all--no other
My childish thoughts e'er cared to know:
~
Which ferst began in Paradis:
~
In drift of tears.  Lo! with what tender grace
Joy holds the world again in her embrace
~
But naught he answers; he only sighs,
~
Of some rude rock pours down its rapid stream.
Divine Achilles with compassion moved
Mark'd him, and in wing'd accents thus began.

Where tightening draws the cord
'Round the throat of brutal Kultur,

Why do you sigh?--

Hysterically sobbing.  I

Thy looks shall be an influence.

So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods).
Then nine long days I plow'd the calmer seas,

A bird,--some treasured plants in jars,
About your casement?

And as the pleasant time he spent

And bear much noble fruit.

Rubbed the pod upon her knee-cap,

Make all the sweeter now her smile divine?

The wave, is but the march of myriads;
There, immense, moves uncouth leviathan;
~
"And Hope enchanted smiled, and waved her golden hair."
~
All the choice that I had was to starve or to lie.
~
Useless are thy tears of sorrow;
~

From me, whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence, and with his good

Its thoughts one moment turned from thee,
'Twas when the combat raged around,
~
The horrible hump--
The hump that is black and blue!
I get it as well as you-oo-oo--

(For "here," said he, "behooves with sail and oars
Each man, as best he may, push on his bark"),
Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd

But I will down yon river rove,

Oh happy time, when laws of state
When all that ruled the country's fate,
~
Without a spot or stain.
Thus bade he Ráma from the air
~
The shape will vanish, and behold!

So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through,
And at his feet he fell. Him there he left,

"The next with dirges due in sad array
Slow thro' the church-way path we saw him borne.

And leagues on leagues of yellow sand,

A shaft at Menelaus? much renown
Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win,

Holding his luck and not himself to blame

Great the pain thy mother suffered,

Mortals! she said, in me behold
A being of no earthly mold:--

Terrific, proof against the bolts of Jove;
That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote.

The man who first proposed to her;

Why thou didst leave thy land,
Thy spouse, thy hearth?

never again can she come

To ride, hunt, trail by the fire-fly lamp;
To track the moose to his moose-yard; pass

"I'm alive ... I've a love ... the sun's shining
And where's the man would be dead?"

But I will liken thee to the sweet bay,
Which I first learned, in the Cohasset woods,

My lov'd Endymion's court.

For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow."
Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,

And blessed symbol of blood divine.

And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow
A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.
~
To the distant shore of Northland,
To the dismal Sariola,
~
But in thy breast the important truth conceal,
Nor dare the secret of a god reveal:
For know, thou Neptune view'st! and at my nod

For the morn I will be far away.

For on her breast, sheltered with one slim hand,
With flaming wings outspread,

Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,
Or red with spirted purple of the vats,
Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk
~
That far exceeds all Bedfordshire

Here, at thy tomb, these tears I shed,
Tears, which though vainly now they roll,
Are all love hath to give the dead,

Rang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.

The queenly things with diamonds in their hair,
The toys of sound, the flowers of magic art--
~
But a bubble that broke in a dream,
~
The pear doth rot, the plum doth fall,
The snow dissolves,--and so must all!
~
If to be mentioned there below thou deignest."

And when he raised his head to speak,
The monitor was gone.

Is somewhere else, and not in the Three Chapels.

And claim their proud birthright;

Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;
A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,

For I am shave as nigh as is a frere.

This sovereign gift of peace that makes divine;
And most at eve, when quiet nights of spring
Enchant the sky, the forest, and the ling.

That flowed before her silently:

I know not: Capys and the rest, who better counsel have,
Or bore the belly of the beast its hidden holes to learn;
So cleft atwain is rede of men abiding there in doubt.

And let us stay until the spring

Busts, cameos, gems,--such things as these,
Which others often show for pride,

No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds--
Captain Sword got up one day,
~
How sweet his music; on my life
~
Nearer still I pressed to him,
~
And Ignorance and Folly have weigh'd down the Scale:
In _England_ they have given new Arts a Rise,
And what in Science wants, increase in Vice,

So by the altar standeth she submiss
And watchful, praying silent and intense
To a strange-figured Goddess, to his sense

With painful scrambling, scratched and raw,
Two hands that seemed like hands of men,
Eased down two legs and a body through
~
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound

To be so frightened of your dad.
I have no wealth of gold to give away,

Fickle maid.
The lofty sky weeps in cloud,
The earth weeps in dews
~
Takes from the intellectual sun its light,
And shrouds the world in universal night?
~
The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,
The body that was clothed with love of old.
~
So Nestor pray'd, and Jove thunder'd aloud
Responsive to the old Neleïan's prayer.

The kiss I gave them.  Sappho, tell me this,

My hair that loved the wind, were they not worth

Where the twain are casting slugs.

Suppose I chucks it up into the sun!--
No--that ain't right--

As a taunt to Hiawatha.

Do you know the story well
Of the Khalif Haroun's sultana?--
When night on the palace fell,

The rippling stream that sports among the hills,
The constant murmur of the mighty seas,

That pleasure gie to me, carle!

From buds that to the dews expand,
The husband and the faithful wife
Pass to dense jungle,--hand in hand.

Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,

Wherewith he wont{2} at Heav'ns high council-table

Whose sleepy rune, hummed in the ear
Of silence, bees and beetles purr,
And the dry-droning locusts whirr;

But no! you bathèd there
Right joyously,

Lo, at last have found our way.
Lo, we at last have found the way

While yours are wreathed with poppies red,
With flowers that Helen's feet have kissed,

And day by day

Behold how all these wait your harvesting!
Moreover, see the darkness of His house!

I am wisdom and wit to the wise,
His visible muse to the poet,

The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn:
In haste our fellows to the ships repair,

Where are thy gods? Or are they dead,

Through the shining hauberks cutting deadly way.
A prowest knight was Gunther, as clear he show'd that day.

As Burnet lovely from her native skies;
Nor envious death so triumph'd in a blow,

It is nothing at all, if you only know how.

Or backers take the bet,

Of the Gothic kingdom.     Grim was the king.

I saw you looking at that dealer's show,

In many a smoky fireside nook
Of Iceland, in the ancient day,
~
The woes that madden, the words that move.
~
Groanin maut, groaning malt, brewed for a lying-in.
Grozet, a gooseberry.
Grumphie, the pig.
~
An offering which shall aye endure
~
And little recked of the country strange
Beyond the gates of hope.
And haply a bell with a luring call

Rise odors of ploughed field or flowery mead.
A vision as of crowded city streets,

Would live full-toned in the grand delivery
Of his cathedral speech:  an utterance

The bird of the morning sings.

And the columns cleft and hewn
On that far-famed spot by Lodi

But he never could tell which he liked the best.

The murmur of impatient fiends

Far off from those hills that shine with day,

Yon carmine glare
Would the west outdare;--

O heart, be at peace, because
Nor knave nor dolt can break
What's not for their applause,

And who didst spare the king of Niniven,

All things that can satisfy,
Having Jesus, those have I.

And I was desolate and sick of an old passion;
Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:
~
And shuns to have her graces spied,
That hadst thou sprung
~
Afterward by gradually withdrawing my presence from you,
So that I might not be compelled to thank you,
~
Gentler than she, of beauty little less,
~
Gold-disked and mottled over blossoms deep;
Come where beneath the rustic bridge
~
Over rock and over river,
Through bush, and brake, and forest,
~
Wilt thou, the bridegroom, till the end,
Still prove the fair one's faithful friend,
~
Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!
As he selected every humble plant,
~
With steady hands he grasped the boat,
And boldly pushed it from the shore;
Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,
~
To sit in hateful Office here confin'd,
Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born,
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,
~
To right and left her fatal spears she sent,
Burst through the ranks, and triumph'd as she went;
~
In thy heav'ns work beside divinity,
I should sit still; or mighty Falkland<90.22> stand
~
Together round her grave we played,
My brother John and I.
~
Why left I Amynta?  Why broke I my vow?
Oh, give me my sheep, and my sheep-hook restore,
~
For Corin was her only joy,
Who forced her not a pin.
How often would she flowers twine,
~
And hung up his treasures so gay.
Then out with a dash, he sped like a flash,
~
There was once a boat on a billow:
Lightly she rocked to her port remote,
And the foam was white in her wake like snow,
~
Are bristling into ax and brand,
And every tuft of broom gives life

from Zeus, or it may be that her own mind was turned. So
she sent me forth on a well-bound raft, and gave me
plenteous store, bread and sweet wine, and she clad me in

What he desired was best for him too, and he held to it firmly.
Be not surprised and alarmed that now has appeared of a sudden,
Gifts come down from above in the shapes appointed by Heaven.

Wrong and oppression like a gnawing blight,
Eating into the heart, till like dead leaves,
~
The drooping boughs disparting, forth he sped,
And then drew in his steed, to ask the path,
Like a lost traveller in an alien land.
~
Always you know he's
Prince Charming by that.
He's always standing on his toes,

His eager eye can trace;
And silence, still as death, has hush'd
The clamors of the chase.

So I, who ne'er forsake my votaries,
~
Brought him, as Love professes,
And chafed his hands with mine,
And dried his dropping tresses.
~
And that will not be so good;
Then let's resolve on some new way,
~
to be popular. The lyrics of Menéndez y Pelayo have also
~
Each soul that strips it of one evil thing

That me thou makest thus tormented be,
The whiles she lordeth in licentious blisse

On the billows' foamy surface,
~
The secret of their unknown woe:
Who pray for sharpest throbs of pain

O Niemen! soon upon thy fords shall rush
Hosts bearing death and burning, and thy shores,
Sacred till now, the axe shall render bare

Great Captain Fairlie! When he drives a ball--
~
He gazes around, not a creature is there,
~
wont. And even as, through feeling more delight in doing good, a
man from day to day becomes aware that his virtue is advancing,

E so ben dove:--Oh vago, a mansueto
Sguardo, oh labbra d'ambrosia, oh rider, lieto!

So to Prince John, a sober soul, sedate
And slow, King Martin left the helm of state,
While to the novel game with eager zest
~
Lulled him into slumber, singing,
"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!
Who is this, that lights the wigwam?
~
soaked and which holds it thus in dizzy ignorance of all
~
And now my pain is lightened since I know
My dream, which was a dream within the dream
Which is our life, fulfilled. And I have saved
~
Each voice that shuns
The noiseful day, and enters there to find
Twilight that naught exalts nor grieves,
~
More weeks went past, and his kind patron bought

Only when there's a funeral
Is anything to be seen."

Bete (beat),       bet,              beten.

The prospect was that here and there was room
For barren desert, fountainless and dry.

Swell the choral hallelujah

And John Brammer made the rammer,
And John Wiming made the priming,
And John Scott made the shot;

And, as my cask runs thick, I say,
The world, too, on its lees is sinking.

Till Suthron raise, and coost their claise
Behind him in a raw, man;

Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;

The tip of each ivy-shoot
Writhes on its neighbour's face;
There is some hid dread afoot

Now more happy times we have,
The king hath overcome the knave.

To ask it of the thing it saw,

A nightingale hid in the leaues there stood
The muse and harmeles Syren of the wood;
~
Before the vine-wreath crown!

Each of this ream, when we have compast round
The dismal way, for first our gashes close

And will no murmurs fill the courts above?
No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?"
"Go then (return’d the sire) without delay,
~
Had not some God my rising fury quell'd,
And set before my mind the public voice,
The odium I should have to bear 'mid Greeks,

A little wind
Stirs idly--as an arm
Trails over a boat's side in dalliance--
~
Doth fill this year thy foolish pate?
’Tis harbouring a useless pain

For I was apt to learn, and, as I learnt,
I loved the teacher of that homely lore.
Deep in my boyish heart he shared the glad

Distil Arabian myrrh;
Nor that, upon the wintry desert's bosom,

Spanish poets have often tried to write verses in

I hold it best that we to them return.'
"When they have come to this resolve, they, through
~
An heritage we mean to hold,
Keeping it stanch and beautiful as of old.--
~
No vain brutish strife he wages,
Never uselessly he rages,
~
So those four abode
~
And their swags put in a cart.
All kinds of men I had
~
We know
Such things as these--Well, I would sterilize,
Or segregate these shriveled seeds and keep
~
Where rougher climes a nobler race display,
Where the bleak Swiss their stormy mansions tread,
~
Still are there left strong battle-eager men,
As Aias, as Tydeides, Atreus' sons:
Though dead Achilles be, I still fear these.
~
For marjoram oil, and every unguent fears
Fierce poison these unto the bristled hogs,
Yet unto us from time to time they seem,

He pondered long, and watched the darkening space
Close the red portals whence the hours had run,
~
While submitting to her father's command, while writing words of
dismissal to Alvan, and even accepting the attentions of a former
conventional and otherwise. He finally forces permission from

Before the starting Caravan has reach'd
The Nothing it set out from--Oh, make haste!

And little she knew that the loving lips

divided us. When I was in, into boiling glass I would have thrown
sweet Father, to encourage me, went talking ever of Beatrice,
saying, "I seem already to see her eyes. A voice was guiding us,
~
Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,
Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:
~
Quoth he, "My men, put out the boat
~
Using not the hand to touch it,
~
From me, and went to feedin'
~
Seal'd in vain!
Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,--
Nay I have done, you get no more of me;
~
What boots it, that thy reins Justinian's hand
Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress'd?
~
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;
How many loved your moments of glad grace,
~
Low sinks the threshold, levelled with the ground;
The man leaps in--to liberty he's bound.
The rest go talking, walking, picking round.
~
And through St. Omer's archer-guarded gate
~
The stern-brow'd tyrant roars and tears the ground
~
They eighteen thousand were;
~
Thousand threads of rain and fine white wreathing of air-mist
Hide from us earth's greenness, hide the enarching azure.
Yet will a breath of Spring homeward convoying attend us,
~
Show me the boy who never broke
~
And flowers that Love's own language spoke,
~
CHRISTUS, as before.
If this cup may not pass away from me,
Except I drink of it, thy will be done.

Passing all guess, whence into me should fly

THE hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks
Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,

Her finish’d web she throws aside:
And lo! I heard the lover then
Low whisper to his promised bride:
~
And he rode the golden way
To the school of Tenko.
~
You are but cruel; and I already have done
~
That no man shal the wyser of it be;
And so we may be gladed alle three.
A good conceyt in my wit, as I gesse,

For her soul upon its journey
From his doorway Hiawatha

But Solyman ran thither fierce and bold,
To cut the plank whereon the Christians passed.
And had performed his will, save that upreared
~
And owe my safety to a friend.
~
Some dire disaster was foreboded,
But failing in prophetic story,
~
Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus
~
Now dewy nights again and rain in gentle shower
At root of tree and flower have quenched the winter's drouth:
~
The beech-burrs burst,
~
And plac'd the milk-pail at her feet.
The profits which arose from thence;

Wrenched, writhing in his agony; in vain;

But in old Sam there is a wondrous change!"

He'll draw me fifteen pun' at least.--

As, to see some of the flowerets of the apple-tree which makes
the Angels greedy of its fruit, and makes perpetual bridal
feasts in Heaven, Peter and John and James were led, and
~
His strength might fail; and cast o'er all his bulk
Hot sand in handfuls.  Thus with arms entwined
~
Answer me! answer me! oh, let me hear
Thy voice, and know that thou indeed art near!
That from the bonds in which thou'rt forced to dwell
~
And the road a-sliding past,
An' every bloomin' campin'-ground exactly like the last;
~
Fresh is the river water,
~
The ground of grief remove,
But still decay both nicht and day:
~
Make the great night.
But the dawn in the sea
~
Is past all cure; then thou reflect betimes
~
Then high my hope ariseth, and my heart is all afire
~
Yet this were to give unto God the eye--
Unmeet the thought, of the humming fly!
I trust there are small things He scorns to see
~
Two elders of the Church of Ephesus
Greet him with salutations from the ship
Whose banner streams--the banner of the Cross--
~
Will he behold them, fading, fly;
Swept from Eternity's repose,
Like sullying cloud from pure blue sky?
~
Out drag-ropes!  With shrapnel!  Hold fast -- 'Tss! 'Tss!
o' course you will know what to do -- hoo! hoo!
~
Or death, it should be thine his doom to say.
I, hearing thou wert with King Charlemagne,
Thither, in hope to find thee, took my way.
~
It lies, a windless land of livid dawns,
Nude to a desolate firmament, with hills
That seem the fleshless earth's outjutting ribs,
~
Y el inmenso tapiz del firmamento
~
From watching them your eyes in tears are gleaming,
And your heart is still; and like a sound
~
When with united squadrons to battle rode the host.
What numbers fell by Hagan and Hagan's chivalry!
~
And manifold bright glories of the stage--
So great the influence of pursuit and zest,
~
Because those signs do visit her again
More swiftly than they visit the great sun.
~
Her voice did charge and bless,--
Chanting steady, chanting meek,
~
"Ah! it's a bad state of feeling. If the knife causes such wicked
"Murray's in the river!"
And they pointed to the spot where the poor boy had sunk.
~
From young Werner's locks; his forehead
Showed a deep wound from the halberd.
~
Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw
Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep.
But should he disobedient prove, and scorn
~
I love my king, I love him well--but, oh,
~
Then his resting-place to alter.
~
It seemed like, "Feel to home, Bill--
Sit down, the place is yours."
Some things we fain remember--
~
Would never be believed.
~
Then the great high priest of Pélé turned to fiery Kilauea.
"Come!" he said, "the goddess calls you!"--and they climbed the
~
A sketch of a rather droll couple--
~
As, round the sleeping infant's feet,
We softly fold the cradle-sheet;
~
Was the only wretch of an author there.
But think, how great was my surprise,
When I saw, in casting round my eyes,
~
At this great fortune, heap'd the table high
With dainties; nor was bread deficient there:
But when his hands the Cerealian boon
~
Yet Khayyam never worried over that--
He kept his Troubles underneath his Hat
~
Gin a body kiss a body,
~
And only one among us--him
We please not--he was seldom pleased:
He saw not far: his eyes were dim:
~
If thou by strength canst take it, shall alike submit to thee.
"Let thy broad lands and mine too be laid in equal scale,
And whichsoe'er in battle o'er th' other shall prevail,

Of life's disastrous eld, on blossoming youth
May gaze, and murmur with self-pity and ruth,
'Might I thy fruitless treasure but possess,

Imposed a gay delirium for a truth.
Grant it:  I still must envy them an age
That favoured such a dream, in days like these
~
Beneath a faded oak from whose tinged leaves
~
Der nackte Leichnam wird gefunden,
~
Just God and holy! is that church, which lends
Strength to the spoiler, thine?
~
The girl I lov'd, but that the will of Jove
~
Perfume of the sage brush oozing
~
Listen and save!
~
O would, or I had seen the day
That Treason thus could sell us,
~
To the boat of Vaeinaemoeinen.
Said the aged Vaeinaemoeinen,
"In my boat is wood in plenty,
~
the whole year, mad, absorbed with wine, covered
with dishonor! For, when we have sound reason, chagrin
~
And brightest helmets put we on, and arm'd
With longest spears, advance; myself will lead;
And trust me, furious though he be, the son
~
On before, the way to show!
Oh, the reckless impious ones!
~
Charged with salt-petre, oil, or sulphur pale,
One and the other, or with such like gear;
~
About another room I knew,
In a mean house -- and soon there, too,
~
But lest his light upon Thessalian earth

"If not forbid against his single arm
Singly to try the even-sworded strife,
~
Where the reeds and rushes quiver,
~
Will strew my path with mortal flowers of song.
O steep and rugged Life, whose harsh ascent
~
I'll not leave Jesus, 233.
~
Thus clamored his mind to his mind:
Not fleshly dole is the sinner's goal,
Hell's not below, nor yet above,
~
Through _his_ fierce nature--
"Dost _thou_ know the man?
Ha! his own tale! O dull and blinded! how,
~
And then no better course he knew
While the fields were green, and the sky was blue,
~
The strength he gains is from th' embrace he gives.
~
These things are managed so well in France
I cannot say, but he made the sale,
And the bob-tailed mare had a flowing tail.
~
The Emp'ror yesterday marched through the pass
Upon his homeward way into sweet France.
For greater honor, in the rear, Rollánd,
~
Is God's great gift of life,
At the first call of duty
They rush into the strife!

The saffron grows to gold, the gold is fire,
~
Secure he leans on his Redeemer's breast,
And sweetly sings himself away to rest.

And thy heart smoulders in thee, to be bright,
Thy one sole refuge from thy one despair,
~
And framed of gold that gems encrust;
And we will lay it safe therein,

She long had known that in her father's coffers,
And also to his credit in the banks,
There was some cash; and therefore all the offers
~
The flowers of the West's fore-dawn unclose.
~
I'll promise 'ee, Jill,
This side of supper

A whole creation, and a single grain.
Speaks he the word? a thousand worlds are born!
A thousand worlds? there's space for millions more:

With these the monarch withdrew to the Himalayas to spend his

About brawn?
About plum-porridge?

Old Floyd Ireson, for his hard heart,
Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart
By the women of Marblehead!

confirmation of my speculations, and the substance of my
hopes. Here lingered the fragment of a happier past, or
stretched out the first tremulous organic filament of a more

And the trader sails where the mist unveils

Was my throat, softer veined than his:
My lips were as two grapes the sun
Lays his whole weight of heat upon

can, if she will, find, without such love as this, enough of
lawful and fitting pleasures to the which to give herself up,
and with the which to pass the time without melancholy. For
~
His garden's simple produce stor'd,
Prepared for him by hands ador'd
Is all the little luxury he knows:
~
I claim, I tell thee, all my right;
And if that image of delight
Rest not within mine arms to-night,
~
Of purple, blue or green, crimson or rose,
~
Desist! or my offended mistress' nod
Will stagnate all thy fountains:--tease me not
~
Which makes the maids whom kings are proud to call
From fair Circassia's vales, so beautiful.
All is in motion; rings and plumes and pearls
~
How sad when we can't in each other confide,
~
The humble school-house of my A, B, C,
Where well-drilled urchins, each behind his tire,
~
From the west the winds came roaring,
From the north-east came in anger,
~
your side--
You'll be comin' back, my darlin'!
O, there's no home like the old home, there's no pillow
~
But, while we paced the aisles,
~
Than comes to this,--
~
small stones, into the deep water she cast her forlorn body.
 A _cho_ is about one fifteenth of a mile.

Shall reign secure and flourish long.
Though lulled in sleep his senses lie
He watches with a ruler’s eye,
~
Each lost the colour that it once possessed,
~
In the oak he maketh pictures
With a wand between his fingers;
Pictures hang from all the branches,

This pair who live for love and ease,
And ’gainst thy peace, as foes, allied,
With tenderest names their hatred hide?
~
Above the peerless victor’s head
~
Cried out falcon from a fir branch lofty:
"O girl lovely! Sinfully you are speaking,
Only past night your love called you lovely,
~
She is a woman: one in whom

knowledge of all? Was it, perchance, that he too may wander
~
After the fall of Troy, Odysseus touched at Ismarus, the

To thee as dear as she, thy maid divine,
Whose frowsy hair his hectic breathings blow
In poppied ringlets billowing all her marble brow.

Draw close the war and drive us on the prows
Of these Phocaeans."  Him the pilot heard;
And turned his vessel slantwise to the foe.
~
Shall give thy honest fame a brighter blaze
Than tyrant pomp in golden robes displays.
~
A clattering drawbridge fell,
And wide the glittering portals slowly swung:
~
Your woman's tact and aid were drawn
~
O come the time, nor distant be the day,
~
The lover of child Marjory
Had one white hour of life brim full;
Now the old nurse, the rocking sea,
~
There is no thing to make him mad,
~
No longer was alone.
For there had come a little hand
~
Slighting the petty need he showed,
He told of his benighted road;
His ready speech flowed fair and free,
~
Where dwelt the devotee,
~
Does, by a careless glance, descry
~
And smeared thy name on History's sacred page!
Forsooth, the Book, once closed for many an age,
Is opened by thy sons--though fraught with pain--
~
Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:
Of heaven’s undrossy gold the gods array,
~
Teasing me to talk and sing.
Welcome, red and roundy sun,
Dropping lowly in the west;
~
Lie broken, conquered.... Let me not fall in silence.
I, the restless one; the circler of circles;
~
Then Menelaus, of the loud war cry, answered him:
'Telemachus, as for me, I will not hold thee a long time
~
That sons to parents, all to Thee may turn;
And ready prove
In fires of love,
~
Mighty for hate or love
Were close above.
White as the fog and fair
~
At stated seasons governing the air;
~
Became lighter than mist.
~
In part they gather, and in part they tread
~
A lily in a wilderness.
Sae sweetly move her genty limbs,
Like music notes o' lovers' hymns:
~
No more shall Life his golden pageant draw,
Nor ever a seed shall spring nor a flower start.
The all-embracing and tender Air is without motion, lifeless
~
I tell you, Dinah, jes' as shuh as you is standin' dar,
~
But thou liv'st fearless; and thy face ne'er shows
Fortune when she comes, or goes;

'Mid icy blasts, and wintry snows,
The Golden Rose still breaks and blows;--
Search w ell and you may find it!
~
For his heart was hot within him,
~
That nothing sweet can enter,
Commoving thee no less
With that forced quietness
~
that we rather drifted out. Our design was, if possible, to get
within the road around the point, and then run the ship on shore;
~
Or fetter'd in thy arms;
~
To eat, devour it all. Grown sick at last,
~
Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood
Before him naked to the aire, that now
~
Powder and wig, and pink and lace,
~
Between two viands, equally removed
And tempting, a free man would die of hunger
~
Tears in her heavy trouble shed,
But not a word to me she said.
She raised her face which grief had dried
~
Could not have tended them more carefully.
~
And it was his martial cloak and shroud!
I stood upon the hills, when heaven's wide arch
Was glorious with the sun's returning march,
~
would or no. And now I do not see how I can find any further
~
A warlike realm, where still the martial race
From Porus, fam'd of yore, their lineage trace.
~
If I had my choice of sailing, I know I'd soonest be

expectation, and misguiding practice.
Of his nobler and more weighty performances, the greater part is
panegyrical:  for of praise he was very lavish, as is observed by
~
Now this little woman her living got,
By selling codlins, hot, hot, hot!
~
Is pliant and expansive; for each limb
Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.
How babe of animal becomes, remains
~
Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes
My words fall short of what bechanc'd.  In two
~
And the Southern Moloch stricken
Shook and tottered to his fall--
~
A wedding or a festival,
A mourning or a funeral;
~
The Eastern archers, Caesar in the West
~
A thought of her I leave behind--
A hopeless thought of thee.
~
O golfer, be quiet, and mark where it scuds,
And think of its paces--of owners and races--
Relinquish the links for the study of studs.
~
Such as might be the faltering ghostly noon
~
Piercing the spirit deeply with delight.
Would I might make these miracles my own!
~
Stand stiff as spikes in mail;
As to the Haut King came at morn
~
O'er hungry waves to thirsty sands,
Flaring at further; she had grown to be
~
For me, I count it fit
~
We, poets of the people, who take part
~
The goddesse selfe to chalenge to the field,
And to compare with her in curious skill
Of workes with loome, with needle, and with quill.
~
There they will surely some April forgather,
Drink once together before they depart,
~
We must be made,
Ere long a song, ere long a shade.
~
The skies will be dull and gray,
~
The scents of the World's End; the calls
That may not be gainsaid to rise and ride
~
And am I then forgot--forgot?
It broke the heart of Ellen.
In vain he weeps, in vain he sighs,
~
This--when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.
Whether he married with the third or fourth
Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,
~
Below us and our dreams: withal
Ten years have past us in this thrall
Since Helen came with eyes agleam
~
Thy night, slow, dark,
Yet song-lit shone,
~
_Warran'_, a warrant, to warrant.
_Warsle_, wrestle.
_Wastrie_, prodigality.
~
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,
To war and arms I fly.

He also against the house of God was bold:
A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,
~
Careering, full and cool,
From sable on to golden,
From rapid on to pool--
~
Man may at first transgress, but next do well:
~
Very angry and indignant,
~
And I with groping dim
~
Who would not say his prayers;
I took him by the left leg,
And threw him downstairs.
~
Playmates of my early summers,
Listen to your sister's counsel:
Cannot comprehend the reason,
~
idea of the subsequent poem of 'The Deserted Village' ('q.v.').
~
And nectar every rivulet with thirst.
Honey and locusts were the aliments
That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;
~
Drench the wind, the Maine wind,
That gulls are dipping thro,
With soft hints, sweet hints,
~
Champagne shall be my wine,
~
Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough
Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."
~
"I have worn it three times at the least calculation,
And that and most of my dresses are ripped up!"
Here I _ripped out_ something, perhaps rather rash--
~
That whiten by night the milky way;
~
Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.
~
Dashed headlong, sword in hand;
But of that gallant band
Not one returned again.
~
Which spake in fashion as I here have said.
And she: "O light eterne of the great man
~
"Of your foul race and without fear or check,
"Luxuriating in hate, avenge my shame,
~
March by the parade,
Waving their toy flags,
~
Wear out the carpet with their shoes
Earning respect; have no strange friend;
If they have sinned nobody knows.
~
Looks both longing and sweet, e'en in the marble yet moist.
Of his embraces she thinks with delight, and seems to be asking
~
Wants to play.
Tom he was a Pi-per's son,
He learned to play when he was young;
~
Absorbing his wisdom with eye and with ear.
Close by, lay the corpse of a man, half in view.
Dear shades of our dead and gone grandmamas! you
~
Word by word, as an acolyte
Repeats his prayers and tells his beads;
Letters full of the rolling sea,
~
"Quick, thy tablets, Memory!"
~
your tender presence, and at feeling you near and
not seeing you and ever hearing you.
If fate has saved us from commonplace errors and
~
High leaps his heart, and hope anticipates the foe.
LXIV. So, free at length, his tether snapt in twain,
Swift from his stall, in eager joy, the steed
~

And sigh for days when they were young,

A dog shrieks in misery from a bridge

Therewith she turned and went from him,
And with such pain his eyes did swim

Was swept with dust; and then, tempestuous black,

A shaft he fitted to the horse-hair twine,
And, turning, stood with outstretched arms, and cried:

Her palsied hands unlaced the shoes--good shoes!--

And let the famed Napoleon find

Sitting here by the window, watching Venus
Go down behind my neighbor's poplar branches,--
Just where you used to sit,--I'm sure you'd come.

By service of a life, the deed

Sickening to hear, and then a stifled groan;

She cried, and wept outright:

That raised thee o'er the brute:
Thy piercing shrieks and soothing strains

And one poor thief on either side
Hangs on his own unworthy cross.

Dangers themselves, o'ercome, the more endear.
Of those retain'd, more wide be the employment;

Huge-boned, and tall, and grim, and gaunt,

From out the crumbling bases of the sand."

And two volumes he bore at his side.

Yet how should our Lord Love curtail one whit

To hearken to him, and the lad had died
On London stones for lack of crust to gnaw

These survive!--yet not without pain,
Pain and dejection to-night,
Can I feel that their poet is gone.

All the walls are decked with crossbows,
All the pegs are hung with crossbows;

Arm-in-arm, they wander under the trees
Everywhere meeting others, wandering arm-in-arm

That chamber built. He framed the solid doors,

Before we part.

Until he's called to claim it in the skies.

And celebrate in so merry a way
That we could never forget this holiday.
So first we chose the loveliest queen,

To the last point of vision, and beyond
Mount, daring warbler!--that love-prompted strain
--'Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond--

But little ere the noontide did he rise,
And why he felt so happy scarce could tell
~
All day until the light grows pale;
~
That, tortured of its old barbarian blood,
Barbarian still the heart of man should be.
Builders there are who name you overlord,

Possess the life eternal, and not _She_?
Lord, Thou hast promised.  Lo!  I give Thee back
Thine own great Word.  Keep it.  I summon Thee.
~
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell;
Nay, if you read this line, remember not

Long in its dim recesses pines the spirit,
Wildered and dark, despairingly alone;

To cope with heaven and earth and sea and hurricane,
Thou ship of air that never furl'st thy sails,

He says this counthry's job is jist a-mindin' av her biz,

High as the heavens, wide as the earth,

The father leaves his charge with God,

Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,
Within the secret court, expos'd in air.
The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,
~
Rudely raine-beaten,
Rusty and moth-eaten;
~
Myself to me--the daily sum of sense--
The long continual trouble of desire--
The stain of blood blotting the stain of lust--
~
Man they that visit Mana,
~
That glowed with wonderful crimson dyes;
~
Calm, how calm on all things lies!
Sleep then, sleep! my heart's delight!
~
He, by two yards in casting bar or stone
Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,
So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,
~
Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;
There hear what Greece has on her part to say."
~
But, toned to softened hues, her walls abide,
Enclosing baptistery, tower, and fane
Wherein yet swings the lamp with brazen chain
~
Would fain be fasting from the vision of,
Will make them come unto a parley with him;
~
And such good cheer ran through my heart, it spurred
Me to declare, like free-born generous wight:
'O pitiful, who for my succour stirred!
~
His hair is a shower of soft gold,
His eye is as clear as the day,
His conscience and vote were unsold
~
Harked back upon her threadbare theme.
Still an attentive ear he lent
~
Und oonderneat' a fenster
~
And for a time forgets the hour glass,
~
amid mortal men upon the earth, the grain-giver. But as for

No stone was there to mark his grave,
No flower to grace--
~
An unaccustom'd guest? but come thou in,
That I may welcome thee with honour due."
Thus, as she spoke, the Goddess led her in,
~
See here a footpage I have brought from York
To serve a lady fair! The boy held out
His hand to Adela, as he would say,
~
And vainly called. My order still is strong
~
Fewer informers, fewer spies,
~
"That threats the Masters of the Spell?"
The dead lips moved and spake,
~
Why longer sleepst thou?  Caorsines and Gascona
Prepare to quaff our blood.  O good beginning
To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!
~
To turn the car at lowest: then o'er the hearth
~
Their bright wings heavy from the shower,
The birds, new-bathed, had scarce the power
~
That sche may thurgh his ordinance
Toward the god do such plesance,
~
The windy rain beats, beats about my door--
Alas for love when love goes wandering!
~
Some theyr londe and lyuelode in riot out wasteth,
At cardes, and, tenys, and other vnlawful gamys.
And some wyth the Dyce theyr thryft away casteth.
~
Thickly covered all the ground there,
~
Enjoyed--but his delights are fled;
Had friends--his friends are now no more;
And foes--his foes are dead.
~
Together both they bent their steps, where rag'd
The fiercest conflict; there Cebriones,
~
Within the folds of Learning's vest.
There, as the listening statesman hung
In transport on Aspasia's tongue,
~
Such man's perverse, eternal war with Heaven!
Darest thou persist? And is there nought on earth
~
Comes royally, at call -
Comes limber-hipped Indiff'rence
Free stepping, straight and tall -
~
I only sigh, -- no vehicle
Bears me along that way.
~
Do come and go.
~
Horrors which nourish an uneasiness

Oh, never so fair, I ween!

Do roll the mighty waves of wrath on wrath;
Nor wilt thou enter with a serene breast

And when Thanksgiving came,

In the castle's chapel dimly
Was a flickering lamp-light burning,

It is full strange to him who hears and feels,

Sweep over the wet leaves of the fast-falling year.'
Me in far lands did Justice call, cold queen
Among the dead, who after heat and haste
~
Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.
~
Cast on this life a kindly eye,
Glad if through its mystery
Faint gleams of love and truth glance o'er my mind.
~
And mothers of large families (who claim to common sense)
Will find a Tiger well repay the trouble and expense.
~
Teaching morality like dancing,
Tell us, for Heaven or money's sake.
~
And what has lost me every earthly friend;
Except a wife--oh God protect and bless,
~
¿Es más que un breve punto
El bajo y torpe suelo comparado
Con ese gran trasunto,

Pasture, and that he be bereined
Be times sefne and sore peined,
Til that he knowe his goddes mihtes,

Evermore declared anew.

For many a pleasant day,

Now ys ther none other to say,
Of hyme he wane the fyld A3/4{a}t day;

I've gethered for her hair.
O let me haud thee, Mally,
~
Wait and watch.  When the host is near,
Shout aloud that my men may hear.'
~
As if it were loth to cease.
~
Just a quiet thought of Thee,
And of Thy sweet charity,--
Just a little prayer, and then
~
Wonderful the salve I bring thee;
It will join the broken granite,

Deus, dementat prius."
The right hand man to the left hand said,

And thereupon imagination and heart were driven

Descending through the waste of night,
Thought 'twas some planet, whose empyreal frame
Had kindled, as it rapidly revolved

Darting thy shadow;

Fast to the side was nailed.
Twin brethren stand
A fruitful mother's pride; with different fates,

A realm harmonious 'tis, of beauty mild,

Lazarus!  Lazarus!  This is my thirst,

To which the people, standing all about,

But deeds are the picture in essence, deeds

No fruitful word, life no power to move
Our deeper reverence, did we not see

I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit
The gray remainder of the evening out,

The bleating kind

There's a happy light in her bright young eyes
And she hugs the cat with unusual fervor,

Will I explain:
I love you dearly,

The heaving bosom, partly hid,

Shall fix the holy cross on yon fair land.

But chiefly in silence they ate; and soon as the meal was done,
Rahero feigned to remember and measured the hour by the sun,
And "Tamatea," quoth he, "it is time to be jogging, my lad."
~
Ah! what a sound will rise, how wild and dreary,
When the death-angel touches those swift keys
What loud lament and dismal Miserere
~
Weaver of a hundred fish-nets,
Of a thousand nets of copper,
Spinning in the days of summer,
~
To exercise their dancing feet,

Had whispers in it of a coming doom;
As richest flowers lie strown about the face
Of her that waits the tomb.

Amongst them down, to his own person joining
The nature, from its Maker far estrang'd,

The kiss their zeal foretold,

And I took two pence home to my wife.
I love nothing, a jolly, jolly nothing,

Gave one white glimpse of No Man's Land and wire;
And as he dropped his head the instant split
His startled life with lead, and all went out.

When rose the dawn, and thrust back kindly night
To Erebus, and through the firmament streamed
~
Psyche, the firstborn spirit of the air.
To thee, oh Love, she turns,
On thee her eyebeam burns:
~
That in the sunshine floats, beneath the blue,
~
In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.
When the Sleepy Man comes with the dust on his eyes,

To say what thou art now, and once hast been?
Once the dear seat of all my earthly joys,

At once the lovers' and the Muses' seats

Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,
Along the champain leisurely my way

That spices fly

Nor fits it to prolong the heavenly feast,
Timeless, indecent, but retire to rest."

And addresses thus the stranger:
Formerly a dog lay watching,

Wove by her hands the wreath of deathless fame.

The young Arts clasp'd her knees, and Virtue smiled.

In the valley of the Pegnitz, where across broad meadow-lands,
Is this, ye Gods, the Capitolian Hill?,

In all the earth     let not anyone ween
That I wrought this lay     with lying speech,
With hated word-craft!     Hear ye the wisdom

But Bill preferred to hump his drum
A-paddin' of the hoof.

Apart he found him sitting, solemn and sad of cheer;
What more might move his sorrow the prince had yet to hear.

And shouts his fearful battle cry:
Whose voice with pealing thunder shakes
All Lanká, with the groves and lakes

When the barley had been garnered."

Fallen into wrath divine,

With eyes which search in closest scrutiny,
Nor yet offend the object they would see.
One, who from feature, act and equipoise,

Shall fragrant odours still be shed.

The ripe June-grass is wanton blown;

About ourselves, and hitherto had held
Irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose.

So they among themselves in pleasant veine
Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond

And, unperceived, through key-holes creep,
When all around have sunk to sleep,
To feast on what the cotter leaves,--
~
Where ships below appear like little skiffs,
While people walking on the strand like crows.
Muse, sing the stir that Mr. Whitbread made;

From spirit's awful fountain; pour'd himself
Through all their souls; but not in equal stream,

Sudden he shrieks aloud, and spreads his hands.
A lurking rock its dreadful rifts betrays,

And Paradise was opened in the wild.

Found a maize-ear red as blood is,

Full of fair celestial ardours,

Quick the victim turned his forehead,

Where never hope shall meet -- like mounting lark --
Far Joy's uprising; and no memories
Abide to star the music-haunted dark:

"It is all heart-breaking.  I don't only mean those beautiful
graves, overgrown with acanthus and violets, but the mutilated

To volleys and answering volleys of harsher cheers;

It speaks of moonlight, and a closing door;
Of birds at dawn--of sultry afternoons.

Of women and children, and young and old.

Like Elivagar's river flowing

Ran through his veins to see that form alone,
And o'er his noble, Godlike face there gleamed

One half-hour guide the rein,

Each day, returning, finds a new remove--
Sorrowing, I spread the sail, while slowly creeps

In secret, slow consumption wears away.

Into the vast and vacant forest

Then from that noblest hill I fled

Where pots and weapons bang and scud,
Where every dead man through some wound

All, men ignored in me,

No rest nor hope, from you apart;
Your life is in the rose you gave,

For me, I think I speak as I was taught;
I always see the garden and God there

The murmuring of a river, that doth fall
From rock to rock transpicuous, making known

Once, twice, it smiles, and still we wander on.

Ear inwrought like a guelder-rose;

With serpents were their hands behind them bound,

Which sways the worlds around:--

And played the game the wind plays, on and round.
'Twas visible invisible glee

On the untasting sand. Stay, now! a seat

We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;
Every clod feels a stir of might,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers,

In other worlds I loved you, long ago:

For beauty, though we all approve,
Excites our wonder more than love;

Or were I in the wildest waste,
Sae black and bare, sae black and bare,

Not for the buying, but for the desire;
Winter ne'er quenched a blaze so bravely fed.

E'en Jove, the wisest deem'd of Gods and men,
In error she involv'd, when Juno's art
By female stratagem the God deceiv'd,
~
These soothing words the ladies said.
And pressed their lips upon her head.
~
And suddenly through the drifting brume
The blare of the horns began to ring,
Like the terrible trumpet shock
~
To joyless LABOUR did we rise;
But full of hope, and glad and gay,
We welcomed the returning day.
~
Making to strike, I shewed my great fury.
These sable skins take as amends from me,
~
And wyth hym a full great route:
These three yemen dred hym full sore,
For theyr lyvës stode in doute.

At that grave ring of anxious faces, all

Break lock and seal; betray the trust;
Keep nothing sacred; 'tis but just
The many-headed beast should know.

When she gave me cigars.

All waving in the wind,

Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel
Deeper, deeper into torment,
To his shoulders into water.

To climb the giddy brink; to pen, for instance,
And fall, if bound to, from a decent height.
I did and missed the laurel; still I go

The Present now retrieves the Past,
God's Eden is in Bethlehem.
An Eden that no walls enclose

The shining foot-prints of her Deity,

Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!

Thy deed, and all is well. Cease not from war

Veiled with a soft light robe. Her tiring-girls
Then led her to a chamber decked with pearls
And paved with sapphires, where the lulling sound

To question thus the weary man:
“Why was I brought, O free from blame,

As like the lightning of the storm

To make me bend to King and Peer.
I could not bow to noble knaves,

Thin flesh all shivering,

When the night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day's occupations
~
And, save the scarce-seen battlement
~
The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,
At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;
At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;
~
And still "Happy! Happy! Happy!"
Rang the voiceless vesper bells
~
Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore
Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd
~
Striving to hide their grief from Argive eyes.
Clasping their knees some sat; in misery some
~
My pen, thought but a feather,
Is heavier than lead;
~
A butterfly kiss of fire;

Within the harbor's mouth and waits the tides
And favoring winds, far to the west to fly
And leave me here to die.

_Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;
Bess, the landlord's daughter,
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair._

The good old quarrel was begun anew;

Again the Plague-breath air itself defiled,
~
Spink, spank, spink;
Brood, kind creature; you need not fear

The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.

Grimly Enyo laughed, seeing the end
Of that dire war; Hera rejoiced on high;
~
The gods dislike to show to us frail mortals
These the most glorious of their attributes;
~
When Caesar made a noble dame a wh***;
~
And in melodious beauty sung,
Brighter than love's and glory's fire,
~
And hushed their weak complaining,
She told them that the black, black cloud
Was quite too small for raining.

To burn and to ban,
From home and help,
The weak who fear the rack!

Oh, the great big Irishman,
The rattling, battling Irishman--
He took so much of Lundy-foot

Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill

"Tick-tock, tick-tock"--and they seemed to mock

By the dew has not been damaged,
If the flint is good for striking;
~
A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart,

Smites down with sword to her that bore the dread Eumenides,
And her great sister; and a cow yet barren slays aright
~
And love than either; and there would arise
A something in them which was not desire,
But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul

Is barter'd love,--how sad to sight
A perjured face! He will be driven

Still fling their shadows owre my path,
And blind my een wi' tears:
They blind my een wi' saut, saut tears;

That flowers within the hollow of Thine hand!
She seeks of Thee that boon, that gift sublime,
The Christian radiance, for this hope of Time!

All things counter, original, spare, strange;
~
Who fetches hence good wine, hams, cheese, and bread;
And makes the sage, who had forgotten long
All taste of partridge since on fruits he fed,

A deep and everlasting peace.
O King of peace, this peace bestow
Upon a stranger here below;
~
The keenness of her pure and tender gaze.

On which all figures fix't their eyes:

Aristophanes, who turned the wise Socrates into ridicule, and is

And from things sordid keep a mind apart;
Then sleep, my child, and take a well-earned rest,
~
Which I myself inhabit.

When their brave deeds my wond'ring fathers told;

Streams out of things diffusedly, because,
Whilst coming from the deeps of body forth

And what remained, ah, what remained but death!
No windy white of wind-blown clouds is thine,
No windy white but low and sodden gray,

And in every deed!

Those many records of my childish years,

A spirit seems to brood

Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,

But ah! no fruit hath crowned her holy vow.

As to his sounding strings he shap'd the song.

Two lofty thrones commanded land and main.
Behind and near them numerous were the tents

In gazing towards your distant vill
I owned you were my dear one still.

As though they caught a broken clue;
So hard was earth an eyewink back:

With halls and touris a hicht,

Missus cooked a dish full,

Upon the thought the posting angel brooded,

By little and by little, Gryphon guessed
What love from him had hidden till that day;
And knew, to his great sorrow, in the other
~
our own side; let us take our places on some hill out of the
beaten track, and let mortals fight it out among themselves. If
Mars or Phoebus Apollo begin fighting, or keep Achilles in check
~
Maria of the Golden Locks--his daughter.
How is this known?  'T is a foul slander forged
By desperate malice.  What! in the night, you say?--
~
This threefold love is mourn'd.  Of th' other sort

It rears at last a broad green crown.
It blossoms: and the children cry,
"Watch when the mango apples fall."

I see--but oh, how far!--the blessed town
Where Liebhaid dwells.  Oh that I were yon star
~
The victor of a thousand foes,
Who proved in Janasthán his might
And slew the rovers of the night?
~
And bowers of trellised vine--
Of nature bewitchingly simple,

Therewith he cast about his shoulders a mean scrip, all
tattered, and a cord withal to hang it, and Eumaeus gave
him a staff to his mind. So these twain went on their way,
~
Of all the neighbouring kings he was the best,
As that, superior to each other wight,
He beauty was throughout the world confest.

A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears:
She seem'd a thing that could not feel

Betrays its owner's florid taste;

Are hers, poor child,--her grave is here!
To-morrow, precisely at eight;

All past! and through the trees we glide,
Emerging on the green hill-side.

Oh, little did the Wolf-Child care,
When first he planned his home,
What City should arise and bear

That so, in spite of all this peeuish strength

H.             A what?
~
Thy birth was in the forest shades;
And all the beauty of the place

I only prayed for thee.
Such wishes held the speaking lip,
Such mood of blessing took me, there,

And I ride the world below with a joyful mind.
~I shall start a heron soon

And waits, with heart devout, Christ's purpose to fulfil.
On Rheims now dawns a cloudless Christmas morn;

Memory, be still! why throng upon the thought
These scenes so deeply stained with sorrow's dye?
Is there in all thy stores no cheerful draught,
~
And the crest that rideth high.
Each eve earth falleth down the dark,
As though its hope were o'er;
~
The tints of the rainbow--bears upon his sting
The deadliest venom. Ere the dolphin dies
Its hues are brightest. Like an infant's breath

The faded vines refuse their hills to shade,

Luna parens mensum numerosa prole renascens:
tu biiugos stellante polos ab Sole gubernas,

Something blue upon the billows,

Successive absolute fiats issuing.

Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights

I drew it from its china tomb;--
It came out feebly scented

Against these views some men no doubt will rail,
But let such take the Bible in their hands,

And tend my light in the stormiest night
That ever did move the deep;

A short repose requests, till Phosphor' bright,

For, put them side by side,

This letter through a friend who will not tell.

The distant cattle raised their heads; the wold
Grew dusty at the top; a waggon rolled,
Drawn by a bickering team of mules whose eyes

The beauty of the starlight in their eyes.

Is stunned, in physical and moral sense.

In sassafras-haunted glen,

While I was reading Pepys or Taine.

Of the Achaians occupy my soul.

Suddenly from out the woodlands

Are you not ashamed?

Turning round to him they bowed,
Much they thanked him, much they owed;

His son Malprimes is very chivalrous,
He's great and strong;--his ancestors were thus.

Where their sweet wings are seen.
They live on what they steal.  Their wings

Intone and bray and bark. Unfortunate!

A shout!--the door thrown open wide!

But scorns the arrogance of gold.
False and fair!  I scarce know why,

And, first th' importance of our end survey'd.
Friends counsel quick dismission of our grief:

Are yet a master light of all our seeing;
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
Our noisy years seem moments in the being

This I said with a careless smile,
And a joyous heart that was free from fears;

Author's Note
Many of the poems in this volume have appeared before in various
~
Now scales the cliff gay-gleaming on the morn,
~
For her my tears shall fall,
~
On Nature's beauteous aspect; and deforms
(Amazing blot!), deforms her with her lord.
If such is man's allotment, what is heaven?
~
And at their labor sing.
~
More merrily than the chastened voice of winds
And waters--yet he often, in his mirth,
~
Up to the throne of God,
That none might question Heaven's decree,
But bless the chastening rod;
~
For him it flows unseen.
The Birds among the Bushes
~
And, being luckier of the two,
~
Lest Ráma from the right had erred,
And jealous for ancestral fame,
He put this question to the dame:
~
And my poor man's a withered knee,
And all the burden falls on me.
~
And sweet as any rose.
I passed beneath the stately Norman portal,
I trod the stones that pilgrim feet have trod,
~
That you should truly let me know
What you have done,--what you can do;
~
The wheels of commerce, and come forth distained;
~
And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.
Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew,
With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew:
~
Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom
To wail his fate in death’s eternal gloom.
He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:
~
As if all nature went to wreck!
~
"Come, dear Child," he said; and leaving the sleeping cats she
~
And long dishonored by the living death
~
While she squats asleep.
Names may be writ; and mounds rise;
Purporting, Here be bones:
~
For tens up the safe mountains at his head.
Few would be fed, not far his course prolong,
~
But there are different opinions about the space intended. See
Greeks, and being dropped at the altar of Jupiter, indicated that
~
Like the soaring gargoyle there!
~
Nor did he turn aside to prove
His Brothers' wisdom or their love--
But calmly from the spot withdrew;
~
Whilst in the air the vernal music floats,
The cuckoo only joins his two sweet notes:
~
“The ghosts below are troubled. These the aid
“My nuptial wish should seek; no longer pray
~
While I touch the string, etc.
Common Sense went on,
Many wise things saying;
~
Lord, how he would hop
~
Upheaved the waves, broad-backed and thronging fast
More than before beneath the madding wind.
~
Maid of Shehawken, kind and true,
Tho' far away we roam,
Few places will we find, O few
~
Of men of wisdom     who will not need
To consider and judge,     ere he sets on his journey,
~
by a slowly dying fire.
When, at last, I am cold--
~
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
~
Was dazzling to behold,
For his chain-mail from head to foot
All glistened o'er with gold.

Said Walter, "a bargain full dolorous."

in the mountains.--_Freneau's note._
Who on this valley's drowning bed
~
Shall thrill with echoes such as ne'er of old
From Roman hall or Grecian temple rolled;
~
First turn plain rash, then vanish quite away.
This thing has travelled, speaks each language too,
~
That naught on earth her griefe might pacifie;
And all the rest her dolefull din augmented
With shrikes, and groanes, and grievous agonie.
~
Bot Brutus, which was with hem there,
Toward himself his herte kepte,
And to Lucrece anon he lepte,
~
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
~
And you, warm little housekeeper, who class
With those who think the candles come too soon,
~
We carry people home -- and so
God speeds us, wheresoe'er we go.
Lift sleepy heads to give us hail.
~
They do it well.
And the echoes jump, and tinkle, and swell
~
To chains condemn'd, as wildly she deplores;
A widow, and a slave on foreign shores.

Chattering in a house all golden,

Dante in the _Divina Commedia_, are formed of 11-syllable
lines in groups of three, with the rime-scheme _aba, bcb,

How cousin Ann climbed up a tree;
And when I chid in gentle fashion,
She flew into a dreadful passion,
~
The sum of weal and safety, lest for thee
All things return to nothing utterly.
~
Here let us in each other's arms
~
A thousand delicate spires of distant smoke
~
Because I go from my mother's door.
From a Spanish sailor a dagger I bought me;

Then all the Gods in close array
With the bright hosts who sing and play,

"There are two living and forty dead."
"A rope, a rope," Gillespie cried:
~
They hunt up violets, and free swift brooks,
From icy cares, even as thy clear looks

Making their throats a thoroughfare for wine.

To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply.
Eat, noble stranger! and refreshment take
Such as thou may'st; God gives, and God denies
~
And, as they lookt from time to time
To the far sky where Daylight furled
His radiant wing, their brows sublime
~
Or animals on plants. Now see! I hold,
As well ye know, one whole link of this chain:
~
the time I find it!  Oh, yes, you're going to
revolutionize things here; you're going to introduce
promptness, and system, and order.  See you've

Have bid our paddles speed.
Where the mad rapids chafe
We've shouted, steering safe,--

Cappun Dime is a fine w'ite man.
He wash his face in a fry'n' pan,
He comb his head wid a waggin wheel,

Wherever she may wander.
Then would I were, &c.
Still, far or near, by wild or wood,
~
When I was young you used to come and stay,
But, now that I grow older, 'tis well seen
What tricks ye put upon me.  Well-a-day!
~
That numbs the soul with icy hand,
And slow-consuming Age.
~
To him each lady's look was lent;
On him each courtier's eye was bent;
~
Da denkt das Kind für sich:
~
While death a prisoner Lazarus kept,
The Son of God stood by and wept;--
And, father, here are tears for thee,

That admiral to a baron's like enough,

'Twas like the motion of sound or sight;

Whose bones bear witness of thy shame and scorn!
And wilt thou idly here attend the morn?"
The king awoke, and saw before his eyes
~
Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;

Make a mighty pretty couple, not to be no kin.
Dey thinks dey's lookin' fine, w'en dey needs lots of stitches.

The Gordon then his bugle blew,
~
Beyond the drowsy waving of the trees,--
~
With bough and branch and leafy crown.
Then with five thousand shafts he slew
~
And the ivy sheen
~
Some with the head of cat, and some of ape;
~
Slowly she slipped her body's bonds; her languid neck she bent,
Laid down the head that death had seized, and left her armament;
~
For I was but a careless child,
And did as children do.
~
In the forest, slender birches,
And beside them, mighty oak-trees,
~
Now resembled in every line and stain
The dead body of her valiant lover
~
The shuttle and the spindle, and became
Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought
With images and herbs.  But onward now:
~
Though afterwards she did, with many sighs--
~
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd
~
"Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,
His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,
Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,
~
That mine forever fair will grace my neck?
But what was that I heard thee muttering
~
Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,
And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.
When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew
~
For ever mystical!
Irrevocable good,—
You dead, and now about, so young, to die,—
~
Gone from me, gone from me!
I cannot kindle underneath the brow
~
With helpless haste, which go
In headlong furious flow
~
Miserable sinners!
~
And green eternal crowns the year,
~
And that I myself may rest there."
~
E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh,
Before the song of those who sing for ever
After the music of the eternal spheres.
~
The eternal morn is bright:
Dews of the heav'nly spheres.

the good intent which constrains me to say it, and very much
rather would I do my duty by loyally admonishing you, and

Eastward! in the pink horizon,
Fleecy hillocks shame
This dim range dull earth that lies on,
~
Until my pointed shafts have slain
This Raghu’s son so fierce in pride,

Touches the _notes_ for each new theme,

Therefore to me ye never will grow old,
But live forever young in my remembrance.
Never grow old, nor change, nor pass away!

And with Jason at time set

Exhort thee to it; neither, in this cause,
Fear thou the Queen, or in the least regard

Oh! the awful desolation
Of my soul!

At length, the bridal song again
Brings her back to her sorrow and pain.
"Hark! the joyous airs are ringing!

Of Smithfield, and that thrice-accursed flame
Which Calvin kindled by Geneva's lake;
New England's scaffold, and the priestly sneer

And so, the blessed angels might come down

But now-a-days about the pahs in idleness they lurk,

The busy world all utterly
Hushed as an old memorial scene.

Sat by the river pool,

Through want of virtue, that is, want of thought

We, there arriving, thrust our bark aground
On the smooth beach, then landed, and on shore
Reposed, expectant of the sacred dawn.

At what age does Love begin?

And, after sunset, when the sky
Becomes a green and orange fan,

When lovely woman stoops to folly

Wrinkled and grey and old,
Teacher of many disciples
That paid for his dreams with gold.

The youth at once arose: a placid lake

They wail an' they fret
Just because they don't get

But the feet question 'Whither?'
Ah, when to the heart of man

'Twas my old husband found the pass behind that big Red Hill.

When length balls shoot no more, ah never more,

Floats another shield on the tide,
Sea-current's eddying ring.
There is told a wonderful tale,

For woman, dear Tibby, but thee?"
Sae, Aunty, ye see I 'm a' in a swither,

Lie mould'ring, drench'd by all the show'rs of heaven,
Or roll at random in the billowy deep.

'Art a virgin, yet no virgin,
Guided by an aged mother,

And sadly longed for its return,
Without it she found no delight,
So she did landlord's bill requite.
~
But strangely misinterpret all you hear.
For you will not put on
~
In over happy dreams, upon mine eyes.
I shall not see thee, nay, but I shall know
Perchance, thy grey eyes in another's eyes,

That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm
The nether horn, his comrades bold the while
~
And dead men wait as long ago,
~
Till ye forget ye're auld an' gatty,

That cares were easy and life's burdens light.
Amid the tranquils sweet around, and to my own design,
I built me castles of a towering height,

"If care with freezing years should come
And wandering seem but folly,--
Should we be loth to stir from home,

The woman, who for him had given assent,
Saw in a dream the admirable fruit

Have stolen my bonny wean away;
~
snatch only one little kiss from her no one will grudge it."
~
How clear it runs and cold
Where "Conn of the hundred battles"
Fought in the days of old!
~
Beside the Stream of Time to wander free:
And still, as nourish'd by the dews of Heaven,
~
Yell just like boys at the circus parade.

She had a woman's mouth with all its pearls complete:
And for her eyes: what could such eyes do there
But weep, and weep, that they were born so fair?
~
I would I might be with thee, when the year
Begins to wane, and that thou walk'st alone
Upon the rocky strand, whilst loud and clear,
~
On our sad shore,
The carmine grape, the moth's auroral wing.
Ah, say how winds in flooding grass
~
Truth for the first time. 'O ay, he defamed 'em,'
The King said, very wisely, once again.
'Ah, but,' says Camden, like a man that strives
~
My husband laughed.  He had slily set
A warping mirror there, in whim
To startle me.  My eyes grew wet;
~
That would not on my bosom sink to rest;
Of little hands that would not touch my cheek;
Of little lisping voices, and sweet lips,
~
Bot as Baiard the blinde stede,
Til he falle in the dich amidde,

An old porcupine, too, just begg'd leave to observe,

artist the most impressive warning our imagination could devise
Coleridge says, an ardent desire of poetic reputation for poetic
philosophic investigation. But the power itself of discriminating

To set me aside from the mart.
Red roses to crown me your lover,

And do I love him still, and on this sand
Still unrevenged, still mourn, still weeping stand?
"Fie no!  complaints farewell!  with arms and art

O tanti est te vel sic potuisse frui!

Of friends so near to us
And life so dear to us),

Unmeaning now, to me,

When you are with me, that my lord, though I
Be after slain, shall by his order die."
Here her discourse, wherewith were interposed

Wild sorceress! me thy restless mood delights,
More than the stir of summer's crowded scenes,
Where, jostled in the din,

Common things transfigured flush
By the magic of the brush,

with dread. An insect eating the heart of the

Spring's Cophetua.
SHE came with garments scant and poor and thin,
And white feet gleaming bare;

Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,

Cross'd the silence between him and death, which seem'd near,

Deep Or-enthistled, in an Argent field
Three Sable mallets--arms De Herancour,
Carved with the torso of the crest that bore,

Was it, frail bloom, worth while?

And a modest droop of the veined lid
Oft hid their flashes--

Sleeps, and the night is hushed around?
~
The pair that wake and slumber not:
The Fiendish, that which shakes amain,
~
I hear a Voice which argues well:
'The Heaven hard has scorn'd your cry;

Night at noon day--cool repose,
Neath burning heavens--a hush profound
Breathing o'er the shaded ground--

There are no gods except the king,

What pang of beauty is in all these songs,
Flooding the heart with painful bliss within--
Was this the folk to which Von Kluck belongs,

Tyntagel on its surge-beat hill,

There too the proud queens parted, each taking thence her way.

The Andes, wrapt in everlasting snow,
Sooner or later, must to ruin go.
Hills sink to plains, and man returns to dust;

Whereas he begrudg’d it of any man other

And was his plaything often when a child;
But somewhat at that moment pinched him close,
Else he was seldom bitter or morose.
~
There lay the fierce and hideous foe,
Sunning himself upon the ground.
Straight at him rushed each nimble hound;
~
He jump'd into a quickset hedge,

And that make for great losses repayment

Which do not lift one drooping leaf, this night of June.
There is no lazy breeze to set them clashing adrift.

To scatter a thousand ways:

Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:
From warring gods thou bad’st me turn my spear,

And frowning, as in angry mood,
At the bed's foot the figure stood,

Dashes down along the highway;

Meaning to cross his cows with heavier strains
Until his yield of meat and bone increased.

For London Bridge is broken down, broken down, broken down;
Blow the horn of Huntingdon from Scotland to the sea--

while hearing of Syrinx, the eyes to which too much watching cost

New Year's chimes.
From the night of forebeing.

Each mew of dismay he return'd with a grin;

I had slain myself, and had willingly died,
Though sworn to be revenged.

Wiped we for this our feet upon
Plied we for this our axe of doom,
No stubborn traitor sparing,

Dwelt together as beloved companions,

Scourges for sin, the solemn tribe are sent;
Like fire and storms, they call us to repent;
But storms subside, and fires forget to rage.

While many a minister below,
And noble, sate in lengthened row.
The youthful pair awhile he viewed

She named a place to meet,
Within an open balcony
That hung from dizzy pitch, and high

A cat duet.

Filling earth's grassy floor
With new desire.

Taxicabs with shiny eyes,

Or taught my soul to fancy aught

When they return and bring their progenies

daring. He made their legs light and active, as also their hands

The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well.

And off he went. Marie ran crying loud
To call the neighbors. They and I, we searched
All that dark night. I called Pierrot in vain;

And to the stack, or the barn-door,

Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around

Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
While she and I together live
Here in this happy dell.

For one who can fill such a place in the choir,
Whose musical talents none can but admire,
Who is loved and looked up to as teacher and guide,

And o'er the dry leaves of the vanished year
His hounds' feet pattering as they drew anear,

The gingerbread’s gilded in Vanity Fair.
Old Dives there rolls in his chariot of state,

The Muses cherish'd up such nectar, sing
Eternal joy to him that loves the King.
To the tune of "Let Caesar live long."

It cleaves its silent way.
Alike the bitter cup of grief,

Pricked gently with the poignard o'er my heart.

My voice unworthy of the theme it tries,--
I would take up the hymn to Death, and say

There waits one word to end my journeyings:

O'er ten square leagues her pennons broad expand,
And twilight swims upon the shuddering sand;

Till over the whole world's sea-board the
shadow of Odin passed,

He sang of a dispute kindled between

A chilly jet of truth upon her, soused
Under its icy spurting she was caught,
And choked, and frozen.  Suddenly she sought

For India's shore through shelves and tempests strays;
That chief shalt thou behold, with lordly pride,

While fancy-whispering Eve spread soft her veil;

Let fall an easy fan-like cape:
To quit the house at morning's prime,

Outwear the patience of the gods.

On these be eighty cars bestowed,
And each with precious treasures load.
A thousand bulls for them suffice,

By riding them down over and over again

Under the keel nine fathom deep,
From the land of mist and snow,

And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament:

The bark shrinks back--the _tree_ survives the same--

The angry self-confessional of woe;

The glittering dragon-fly, and deep within
Run the brown water-beetles to and fro.

With conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em,

May hear Despair, which truly saith

Why is the sea-gull flying?
Friend, in my mountain-side demesne
My plain-beholding, rosy, green

And ah! if my fate ever reaches your ear,
One tear of compassion my DOLL will not grudge

For the Angels fanned them with starry wings
And the waft of visions of unseen things.
And the next gold day waned trembling and white

To see so awful when he frowned

shambling gait and broad of brow were feeding no great way

Little coats of fur!
Days to doze and doze,
And what pleasant dreams they dream

What has become of the children all?
How have the darlings vanished?

Declare, O Muse of mightier wing,
Of loftier lore, than mine!
Both human and divine;

And are you bruised and scarred by many a blow?

That pleasant capital of painted snows;

And the poppies weep o'er the red-spilled lives:
~
Where is Thy favoured haunt, eternal Voice,
The region of Thy choice,
~
Mother! flowers that bloom'd and perish'd,
Strew'd thy path the bridal day;
Now the bud thy grief has cherish'd,
~
Joins with a delicate web remotest strands;

An eastern Governor in chapeau bras
And military coat, a glorious show!

We are anhungered after solitude,
Deep stillness pure of any speech or sound,

His lands were barren made,
His cattle died within the field,
And nothing with him stayed.

When the lee shore churns in saffron spume.
And the fluctuant ocean's plume on plume

And as solemn as any ancient palmer,
No less than nine

The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets
A sudden interruption to his road.

I wondered, while he seared the world,

Pigeons know my silent bells,
Winds touch them and wonder.

Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,
That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,

Why nilt thou speak? -- why not thy face disarm?

Prop of my dearest hopes for future times.
Why shrinks my soul half blushing, half afraid,

Motion'd him to be silent; vainly so,
He look'd and look'd again a level--No!
"A Serpent!" echoed he; no sooner said,

“Go mak a hoil i’ t’ice!”
I turned ma rahnd wheer t’sahnd com fro,

The flowing reins quick follow'd. Quivering shook,

From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.
Peter began with neither gold nor silver,

“If still thou doubtest, name the gift thou lik'st,--
“That shalt thou have; for that will I bestow.
~
And yet one thing Time cannot wrest from me.
~
The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out
Through the blinds and the windows and bars;
And high overhead and all moving about,
~
That fanned the flickering flame of life
~
With it mov'd also; and like swiftest sparks,
In sudden distance from my sight were veil'd.
~
Those dullest millions, pent
In life-long banishment
~
When dreams, relaxing, scarce their captive keep;
~
And on that night he made a little song,
And called his song 'The Song of Twist and Plug,'
~
The volume of Long Ago.
But I--I can still remember
~
(Did the veil of the temple sway?)
~
Had silence upon every side imposed.
~
Drove the cows into the marshes,
~
See how he fell in distant Spain, unchronicled,
~
It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire.
O'er dale and hill the summons flew,
Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew;
~
That like a curvèd olive leaf of gold
~
And through the thick confronting kings,
With hands on all their javelin loops
And shafts on all their strings;
~
Is the prop of his house, and the end of his wealth.
In the heaps of the miser 'tis hoarded with care,
~
For I do love thee with such passionate love,
That life itself, if weighed against that love,
Were scarce a feather in the scale.
~
Tranced, fanatical they shrieked and sang:--
"Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?"
Hallelujah!  It was queer to see
~
"Let William be ador'd!"
The Tories came with long address,
~
More flowres I noted, yet I none could see,
~
How Lycidas was dead, and how concerned
~
And silently and slow they crept away,
~
Rests not on sand, nor slender post and beam.
Below the shifting sand, on solid rock,
The mason safely laid the buttress stone,
~
To her twa een sae bonnie blue.

Between this hour and then be lost in fears,
Or told in obscurations and vain faith
In what has been your long security;

CATHLEEN (_sitting down_)
When I am rested I will need no help.
I thought to have kept her from remembering

And note thou of this just and pious realm
The chiefest nobles.  Those, highest in bliss,

Who their carols rouse
O'er the meadows, browse
Not a cloud was seen

Here they made him large and larger,

Who, like a foul usurper, went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
What could he see but mightily he noted?

Which flew out of sight,
Above houses so high,

We never can forget
The poisoning of Maguire that is gone, boys, gone--
Our high Star and true Apostle that is gone!

Bowed full of living dew.
Down deep, fair fields of Heaven,
Beat wafts of air and balm,

By letting her devote to dress;
Time which they should frequent spend,
~
Ever through the live-long day,
And the monarch never tires.
Sudden comes the answer curt,

Who gathers but that he may give,
And with his fellows shares his all.
But now the lilacs bloom again and give us their perfume again

Welcome, black Northeaster!
O'er the German foam;
O'er the Danish moorlands,

They to the hermit’s son replied:
“His longing shall be gratified.

By what and in what manner Love conceded,
That you should know your dubious desires?"
And she to me: "There is no greater sorrow

Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,

“That should hard fortune keep me from his arms,
“He'd perish. Stranger, while thou may'st, depart;

The middle of the arch.

Waited vainly for an answer,
Long sat waiting for an answer,
And repeating loud and louder,

Secure from Gods and demons live,

That she forget us not in after years;
For we have seen the light, and it were grievous
To dim that dawning if our lady leave us.

The straightening circle, for the first pressed back
On those behind; did any shun the foe,

And there are all his clothes, but never him.
He's down under the prison in the dim,
With quicklime working on him to the bone,

'Oh, wretched man that I am! what is to befal me at the
last? I fear that indeed the goddess spake all things
truly, who said that I should fill up the measure of sorrow

New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?

Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;
Because this beast, at which thou criest out,

There it beat on our bended necks.

O, soothe him whose pleasures like thine pass away!
Full quickly they pass,--but they never return.

From thence, to everlasting woe:
I do believe the good, and I,
Shall live with Him eternally:

'Tis not deep as a river, but who'd have it deep?

And breasts like snowflakes drifted.
A strange noise sounded in my brain;

And, in the secret regions of the air,

When 'tis light and pleasant day.
A plum so blue, a cherry red,

Yf it were his wyAEsAEs,
He shold com as a doughty knyght,
With a Geaunt for to ffyght,
~
In the outer world that was before this earth,
That was before all shape or space was born,
Before the blind first hour of time had birth,
~
The endless toils attending worldly cares,
With mind reposed, all discontents rejecting,
~
And we're like mama's tale of the Wasp and the Bee.
I remember it said, little children beware,
~
Is big with waves that wait the Morn's decree,
As I, thy vassal, wait thy beckoning smile

Yet when he found the jade vase he was sad,

Who can help the grave Untamo

Murdered and unacquit while that man's father

No druggist came, by art or reason taught

"The French are gone to Martinique with four-and-twenty sail!

The massy stones, though hewn most roughly, showed
The hand of man had once at least been there:
But from this object sinking back amazed,

With fair unearthly beauty, and the air
With such ambrosial perfume as is born.
When morning bursts upon a tropic sea,
~
Ever among us a lean old man
Keepeth his watch and ward,
Crying, "The Lord hath set you free:

"With a Jove like myself, who am nine times as great,
"You can join, like their soldiers, to heave up this weight."
So to it they went, with handspikes and levers,

Never mind, baby, mother is nigh;

To fertile Sparta, or to thirsty Argos.
The bitter cup of thraldom shall I drain,

Far down in the depths below him;
See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,
Like a sunbeam in the water,

To what strange end hath some strange god made fair

After what wise the singing would have changed thee

Is oarless all and bare,
And the swift south-west wind hath maimed thy mast,

And dash'd the island as it's waters rose:
Yet peaceful all within, no tumults there,

Eighteen six, came William Bledsoe,

And blend his happy life,
Far from the Gods, with hers;

"The fever of my spirit's pain
Heal thou with heavenly scorn;

'Mong garden joys at play:
Or a sundown chaunting of solemn rooks:

The wind blew off an ice-field, raw and chill,
Daunting man's body, tampering with his will;

Lives there a nobler knight, more strong

To worship there Ideal Loveliness.
On that pure shrine that has too long ignored

Between heaven's rival armies fiercely waged,
She bore the Will Divine from rank to rank,
The chosen courier of Deity.

Well, I didn't shirk my promise, and I helped the thing, I guess,
For she died on Cambaroora when the STAR began to go,
And was buried like the diggers buried diggers long ago.

And I myself an empty tomb on that Rhoetean coast

Only sung in part by heroes

I waked, to find it first awake,
I rose, -- it followed me;

There, on the black bough of a snow flecked maple,

The noblest, and who offers richest dow'r,
~
Footgear comfortless and rude!

To pillow and bless at night,--

Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,
Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine
That she whose beauty made Death amorous

The home you built but yesterday
In death to-day is sinking,

But 'twas beyond a mortal's share
To wander solitary there:
~
With grandeur welled from unsuspected springs, --
~
A soul from sin
Or smooth the way to heaven.
A smile may lighten a falling heart,
~
And dropped it in the glowing mass--no priest did this enjoin.
Nor did they hope to win applause from priest and saintly friar;
If God were pleased they asked no more, nor more did they desire;
~
The loyal heart that she alone can sway,
~
And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,
And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,
To which the little elves of chasm and cleft

Yet bravely swallow down defeat,

Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.
Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventurous Eve,

We Tories, who lately were frightened away,

I woa'd my mules mighty easy

Chance-born, order-less, hark, they are marching,
Hearts and tides and stars to the One Law,

I looked and saw your love
In the shadow of your heart,
As a diver sees the pearl

Where John, by Roger's brick-bat, chance'd to fall,
And Roger had a key that could undo it;

And this old coat with its empty pockets,

Prief, proof.

Given kindly from thy hand, 'twas sweet
As costly fare or princely treat

At one of them there public shows,

It rained still. But slow-treading night came in
Closing the weary eyelids of each sense.
The very consciousness of self and soul
~
My heart with gladness, and a share
~
She yearned, with arms outstretched; as dawn arose
Exultant from the sea, and with clear rays
~
Again stern winter came, with cloudy skies
~
Ah! nevermore shall I behold with joy

Like virtue, hid in ev'ry heart;
'Tis hence, reviving warmth is seen,
To clothe a naked world in green;

The gleaming tides, or rise or fall;

And there was an end of their Rilloby-rilloby,
There was an end of their Rilloby-rill.

She, not so merciful or kind,

Brighter yet thy promised fair one.

Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn!

I bring you life and the beauty of the plains

Or the formulas of creed?
Truth awaits the test of beauty,
Good is proven in the deed.

From him some bribe thy venal tongue requires,

A singer gives her soul's wild melody,--
Watching the squirrel store his granary.
Or, 'mid old orchards I have pictured thee:

The Hero and his Troops who'd caus'd their Flight.
Puff'd with conceit, they Espionage neglected,
So got a visit, sooner than expected.

But his grandma was in town,
So he doubled up into a wheel
And rolled himself down.

Truth under fiction I impart,

Of honey in the saltest tear;
And though he fares with slowest feet
Joy runs to meet him drawing near;

To feel in every vein the glorious fire
Of Eden, and to cry, "Oh, to be free!"
To cry, "Oh, wipe the gloomy stain away,

I quite think we must fight till there's one of us kilt,

And this shall be for music when no one else is near,

And sweet are lute and harp and roundelay;
But for the zealot who ignores the cup,

To celebrate his natal day
By feasting happy hours away

As to sit down content with that:

Destroy me--who shall then describe the fair?
This my light Muse to thee high glory brings:
When the nymph's tapering fingers, flowing hair,

maintaining that there exists no other so fine.

Crisp-haired, well-knit, with firm limbs often tried

In terrors past away.
Nor did the demon vanish thence
Before the dawn of day.

O sweet content!
Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexéd?

The Blue Horizon wuz a mine us fellers all thought well uv,
And there befell the episode I now perpose to tell uv;

I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?
Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,

On the gleaming of the water,
On the splendor of the sunset.

He who makes fathers chary still to children,
Even such was I, and such was I perceived
By Beatrice and by the holy light
~
Far in dim fields cicalas jargoned
A thin shrill clamour of complaints and cries;
~
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them.
They hear no longer these succeeding measures,
The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang:
~
Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.
~
But answering through the dark, she said
(It was a woman): "Eh, ye need not fret;
~
And flown from tree to tree,
Catching gnats and flies, to feed

Yet I the king's behest shall all fulfil--
'Nothing withhold to heal my brother's ill.'
"So in the gaze of dawn and wondering flowers

Lost the words of master-magic,
How to fasten in the ledges,

Where Sákra sate above the gods, and spake
Before the gods the message of the king."

Then turning round as to himself he said,
'Now comes the hour that I have prayed to see--

In me alone, she vowed.  'Twas to cover
The cost of her headstone when she died.
And that was a year ago last June;

The trembling heart to bear.

Free as young Lyttelton, her cause pursue,
Still true to virtue, and as warm as true:

Or sad Abimelech, to sigh,

Thou saw'st beneath a fair disguise

Such signs are not for you.

She only mingled with the combatants;
The others all were absent; they, serene,

As may beseem the wandering harper's tongue,
Who of the glory of his Queen hath sung,
Outside her castle gates in wind and rain.

Why weep ye, O women of Corinth?  The doom ye have heard
Is it strange to your ears that ye make it so mournful a word?
Is he who so fair in your eyes to his manhood upgrew,

And shall not soon depart.

We'll roam creation
Where blue is king,

And one for another sin.
Or ever our tears began,
It was known from of old and said;

A handful of yellow clay,
And a Fifth Great River shall run,

Shot from those brows that did my sin reprove.
Thou gavest her those black brows for a bow

The which that Orbis cleped is.
And therupon he telleth this,

On its own unity revolving still.
Different virtue compact different
Makes with the precious body it enlivens,

Leaves to their King, then, parting, gives command

Which shows where life's true kernel's laid,
Its wheat's fine flour, and its undying force.

To seek thee out? Thy bosom is the goal
Of all my thoughts, and quick to thy control
They wend their way, elate to be alive.

Effrontery of that request!

Rose yet the more, and at his soldiers' swords
One look he cast, forgetting for the time
What robe he wore; but soon Metellus heard

The beauty a flower-land hath.

And always do

Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance
Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,

And left me; but alas! why did he so?
And when the seas wax calm again

The world with living tongue and burning wing.
I came, and Man sat caverned with the brute;

Furnish support to any,--nay, it must,
True to its bent of nature, still give way.
Thus in such manner not at all can things

Where is thy sting?  O Grave....

As may never be fought again!
We have won great glory, my men!
And a day less or more

Just as Hamlet's ghost, we're told,

I must be thy sad servant evermore:
I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.
Alas, I must not think--by Phœbe, no!

Wherein my Lady rideth!
Each that draws is a swan or a dove,
And well the car Love guideth.

I fear that this bar does not trust.

Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, is thrust
Like Elbert Hubbard forth; her Words to Scorn
Are scatter'd, and her Books by Critics cussed.

And song, who spoke so beauteous,
Will speak to us once more;

Behold the unsocial hearth!--where once the fires

Whose peaceful bells ne'er sent around
The bloody tocsin's maddening sound,

By means and stablished ordinance of God;
For God is wiser than a good man is.
But never shall new grass be sweet in earth

Now, coaches and chariots! roar on like a stream;
Here are twenty souls happy as souls in a dream:

O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!
For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,

rather yield it to you, at once, than fall from your good graces
~
Its far away buzz I hear.
Above on the gray old tower

And tokens and favors,
And all sorts of things

Were I and my companions, when we came

Canto CXVIII. Anasúyá’s Gifts.
Thus by the holy dame addressed

Washed across the flooded leas;
And the olive rushes, leaning

I saw her white hand's lifted rose

Its many mischiefs did deplore
Except when England mounts the car.

A boast how vain! what wrecks abound!
Dead bards stench every coast.

That stole into my bosom, when beside

Thou canst not mend these things if thou dost come.

Of rimes or riots at your feasts,
Orgies of drink or feign'd protests;
But simple love of greatness and of good,

A "moral position" shipt off for Barbadoes.
The whole Bench of Bishops stood by in grave attitudes,
Packing the article tidy and neat;--
~
Some walnuts cracking at the lip,
And added to these a barberry slip

Cold crept their blood; when, through the tumult ran

Its people once within more crowded were,

Of all that I possess!  The Publican,

From the ironworks of Albbruck
Even came the superintendent;
He alone played the viola.

Let me see, is it Shakespeare's? no, 'tis n't his either;

Soon as Rollant his senses won and knew,
Recovering and turning from that swoon.

And gadding vine, the cavern's entry case;

And looked upon the guarded dame.

Shall mock the mind with their remembered powers.

The while, beside the altar's font,

Underneath the fragrant pine-trees,

With large blue eyes and steadfast gaze,
Her yellow hair in net and braid,

Two of a kind.

The aiery shop of soul-appeasing sound:
And beat a summons in the same
All-soueraign name,

The old man spoke reproachful; at his words
Up rose nine warriors: far before the rest,
The monarch Agamemnon, King of men;

Thou sayest I ne'er shall taste of Lethe's draught?
I said so, yes! But wherefore ridicule
Gray hairs? 'Tis true that they, unlike fair tresses,

Sang the singers with their singing,
The enchanters with their magic,
To the rapids of the rivers,

Nor to banks of little rivers;

Led to fruitful trees and forests,

Challenging each to each --
This from her mountain-side,
That from her burthened beach.

I knew I deserved the whipping,

Giving him all encouragement, for much

That is closed with a terrible terminal wail,

Loud shouting, blazing like the quenchless flames
Of Vulcan: Menelaus heard the shout,
And, troubled, commun'd with his valiant heart:

The red lamp hissing through the midnight air.
Trembling, across the plain my course I held,

His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd

First, singing, to their notes they mov'd, then one
Becoming of these signs, a little while

Friends, kindred, days,
~
O for the bright complexion, cordial warmth,
And elevating spirit, of a friend,
~
Nor those false damsels once vouchsafe to hear,
That in melodious tunes their voices strain,
~
And the katydids and crickets hollers "Haly!" all the night.
~
Windows rattle above our beds;
We reach vague-gesturing hands, we lift our heads,
Hear sounds far off,--and dream, with quivering breath,
~
Invention of letters, figures, crotchets
Mrs. Delany's and Mrs. North's paper-gardens
The horologe of Flora

And groves, whose only loss new sorrow brings.
And yet I would the worst of fate endure,
~
Such as day may own.
Day has record of pleasure and pain,
But things that are done by Night remain
~
And the Dove's heart still beats in Genevieve!
Still she the presence feels,--resumes the guide,

And stop the robbery of corn,
Which was no longer to be borne.

Gloomed over his shrunken power;
And without the walls the hemming host

Sing of the golden season coming.
But, gazing out on the sun-kist lea,
And hearing a thrush and a blue-bird singing,

To the bottom, his Highness, the Prince Bishop, further,
Of his clemency, offers free PARDON and Grace
~
Of the returning dead.

Counsel is also greater, more increased
The power of mind; thereafter, where already

For there is wondrous more than the joy of life
~
To quit his own obedient son,

And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
~
Three fishers went sailing out into the west,
~
His hounds to bring the wild deer hame;
His lady's ta'en another mate,
~
A wand'rer I was left to range
~
Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.
~
Like a sun-beam bathes his face;
~
Where the wide winds blow,--
But oh, I shall cry at night
When none will know.
~
Kings, queens and knights, exalted castles see,
Undone by pawns and powers of base degree.
Positions gained at a tremendous cost,
~
And onward hurried where the portal vast
Showed praetor, tribune and plebeian massed
With traders from afar beyond the blue.
~
Can toils, like yours, in cold oblivion end,
~
By a confused sound that issued from it.
As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
~
And what is never lost she keeps thee still lamenting.
Not like the Gods am I! Too deep that truth is thrust!

With merry shouts and laughter.
But now,--O nakedness of plains
And mountains! Withering

Steadily from the irresistible sea.
Thus the East laughed and whispered, and the tale,
Telling itself anew

For of þe erth we co{m} all, & to þe erth shall torn agayn;

Thus Angad bade the chiefs adieu:
Then on the ground his limbs he threw

"But the way I am going to tell--
The key of your heart it will open them all:

And let the trumpets blare,
And lift upon your shield

Would shut the door that he might sit alone.

Straight his lord he answer'd, "'Twas Hagan did it all;

After spending the winter at Goslar, Wordsworth and his sister

Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved

Reaping and singing by herself;
Stop here, or gently pass!

On sunny uplands,
Looking over thy waters

In little lights,
Like will-o'-the-wisps flickering, fluttering,

From Adam's ancient years
~
Expostulations, passionate appeals,
All that the human heart most fears or feels,

--National voices, distinct yet dependent,
Ensphering each other, as swallow does swallow,
With circles still widening and ever ascendant,

"Peace on earth," rang the chorus seraphic,

To-day in the rain
I saw that it was his umbrella!

Howling, and scourg'd with ignominious stripes."
Thus as he spoke, upon Thersites' neck

Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall,
The cue-owls speak the name we call them by.
Come from the window, love,--come in, at last,

By my troth I sorrow / if ill to them have happened.
"I'll gladly make atonement / as doth to them belong.
Hath any them affronted / or done them aught of wrong,

Come, then, since all things call us,
the living and the dead,
And o'er the weltering tangle

if you are lost,
what is Paros to me
if your eyes draw back,

Brooding on her deep fall, the many strings

Through every wave, and inwardly the land was terrified
Of Italy, and Ætna boomed from many-hollowed side.

Here break we off, as the good workman doth,

Bliss! sublunary bliss!--proud words, and vain!
Implicit treason to divine decree!
A bold invasion of the rights of Heaven!

Now March was gone, came April in,
And a sea fog settled down,
And forth sailed he on a glassy sea,
~
He leap'd amid a murderous band,
And saved from outrage worse than death
And how she wept, and clasp'd his knees;
~
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle's compass come;

And when at length we have finished these
Then comes the struggle for degrees,
Will all the oldest and ablest critics;

And out of their greene mantletts dare to peepe
O tell me then, what rude outragious blast

Wilt marry me on Monday?
The cat sat asleep by the side of the fire,

Some great idea's all-subduing spell--

Sailing away together.

By daring pride, by lust of fame inspir'd,
Who, scornful of the bow'rs of sweet repose,

But love has rose-buds of the past
Far dearer than them all, Mary,

Who hated Snarl and all his breed,

But my son is wise, and may yet return,
When the drums have died away.

Answered with a song as merry.

Art thou, my GREGORY, for ever fled!
And am I left to unavailing woe!
When fortune's storms assail this weary head,

For one short hour; no, even as the trees

Of worldly longings to be wise,
Of Passion dwelling on forbidden sweets:

How the Greeks rush'd tumultuous to the main;

And clothes the forest with its robes of green,
As covert for the bison and the deer,

With the strides of Lemminkainen."
Wicked Hisi heard these measures,

I am lord of my own habitation,
~
On then, my brothers! every blow
Ye deal is felt the wide earth through;
Whatever here uplifts the low
~
She gaz'd into the fresh-thrown mould, as though
One glance did fully all its secrets tell;
~
How may we lead the Vánar host
In triumph to the farther coast?”
~
Soon as the fiend had set her down
Within his home in Lanká’s town
Triumph and joy filled Indra’s breast,
~
To splash beside the splashing bream
~
To a bridge invisible;
When the hid and perilous
~
He spar'd, and bade him bear the tidings home.
Such Tydeus was: though greater in debate,
His son will never rival him in arms."
~
Bonnie wee thing, cannie wee thing
The tither morn when I forlorn
Ae fond kiss, and then we sever
~
forth. And the violent blast seized my men, and bare them
towards the high seas weeping, away from their own country;
but as for me, I awoke and communed with my great heart,
~
Would hear no more of peace, but vengeance cried.
Now here Marphisa hurried, and now there,
~
By this the sun was all one glitter,
The little birds were all in twitter;
~
I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,
Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,
"Look that from me thou part not."  Straight I heard
~
Bent on sailing with the first kind zephyr.
~
The aching heart, the aching head,
~
But still within my foolish brain
There hangs a pale blue evening sky,
~
Down his throat you might happen to slip, my dear,
~
The second, that was a chestnut man,
~
His paly circlet, at his warning lamp
The fragrant Hours, and Elves
Who slept in buds the day,
~
The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
~
The hapless lover and his bride shall stray,
By night unshelter'd, and forlorn by day.
In vain the lover o'er the trackless plain
~
And post and pillar, with a sound
~
The breath of kindred plumes against its feet?
Sometimes she is a child within mine arms,
Cowering beneath dark wings that love must chase,--
~
Thy ravish'd virgins shriek in vain;
~
And, tho' _one_ little Neddy we saw in our drive
Out of classical Nampont, the beast was alive!
~
Like impressionist pictures, or Wagner's rugged music, the very
absence of conventional form challenges attention. In Emily
particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
~
My huge desire such favour to obtain,
Forces my words from me in my despite,
Constraining me to tell the things ye seek;

Hark to the sound of his hoofs, they say--

O'er wave or field:  yet breezes laugh to scorn
Our puny speed, and birds, and clouds in heaven,
And fish, living shafts that pierce the main,

On the fronds of the cactus,
Where pale blue the gleaming
Of fir and cypress,

Drive the game within these borders,
To these far-extending snow-fields.

She grew in beauty, and in pride,

Once more in a sea of faces,
I only saw one face;
And life grew bright with a new delight,

And one, the Harvest-Moon.

And it was come to love me when
None lived to love me so again,

Thrilled upward through the ground,

Fired the youth to evil conduct,
Singed the beards of men and heroes.

One Christmas, in the early din
That ever leads the morning in,

When the sun shines warm and high
Robins cluster round its brink,

I bowed to him, and begged, polite,

And o'er my low green bed, with bitter moan,

Then answered back in pantomime

The lips of fire;
Love thinks no sweeter tunes
Under enchanted moons

When the lamp went out by my bed I woke up with the early birds.
I sat at my open window with a fresh wreath on my loose hair.
